  		<h1>Press</h1>
		<p class="last">
			STEAM Press is the communications arm of STEAM. It is a combined group between RISD and Brown and makes periodic publications on our updates—we call this <a href="catalogue.html">Catalogue.</a> They are also in charge of webmaster roles for STEAM.
		</p>
  		<h1><a href="bioSTEAM.html">BioSTEAM</a></h1>
		<p class="last">
			BioSTEAM explores the intersection between living things and their visual aesthetics. Whether that is by understanding biological systems through art or merely highlighting the inherent visual beauty that is present in all aspects of Biology, bioSTEAM seeks to create a relationship and open a dialogue between the two disciplines. We hold events and workshops like, Animal Animation: A demo of morphology in motion and Fabricating Nature: biologically-inspired 3D printing workshop.

  		<h1>Human + Computer</h1>
		<p class="last">
		Transhumanism is the belief that the human race can evolve beyond its current limitations through the use of science and technology. However, will our accelerating transformation into cyborgs be a form of transcendence or are we building our own prisons of technology?
		</p>
  		<h1>STEAM Pavilion</h1>
		<p class="last">
		RISD+Brown STEAM are teaming up with Providence local <a href="http://www.pneuha.us">Pneuhaus</a> to design and create an inflatable pavilion for flexible use. We seek to create a comfortable space that can be repurposed as a gallery, workshop environment, presentation room, or for other spatial uses.

  		<h1>KinderSTEAM</h1>
		<p class="last">
		KinderSTEAM is Brown/RISD STEAM club’s partnership with Jewish Community Day School of Rhode Island, a local Providence school for grades Pre-K-5. Since January 2014, JCDSRI has generously opened their doors to student teachers from Brown and RISD to lead discipline-bending lessons to supplement the K-5th grade pedagogy. JCDSRI stands out as a progressive education initiative because of their “Design Lab” curriculum, which is led by Sari Guttin in a dedicated Maker Space within the school. Past workshops have allowed JCDSRI students to have a hands-on experience with units on the moon, geometry, optical illusions, animal ecosystems, or addition. Each lesson applies methodologies and principles unique to art and design thinking, such as experimentation with material, iterative problem solving, and storytelling, to STEM-related content.
